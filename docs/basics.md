## What is a smart contract

Smart contracts are quite much like regular programs or applications except that they live and run on a blockchain.

They are not real legal contracts, but they have the power to force their programmed behaviour in a transparent manner. And that is their superpower: everyone can see what a contract does and knows that its behaviour is guaranteed forever.

## How smart contracts work

Smart contracts are programs that run on a blockchain network. They are designed to enforce the terms of an agreement between two parties, without requiring the intervention of a trusted third party such as a lawyer or an escrow agent.

Smart contracts work by using computer code to define the rules and conditions of an agreement. Once the code is deployed on the blockchain network, it becomes immutable and transparent, and all parties can verify that the contract will execute exactly as written.

One might think that smart contracts are perfect for enforcing an agreement between two parties. So the parties would define the terms of their agreement in natural language, such as the delivery of goods or the payment of funds. The smart contract developer would then translate these terms into code, using a programming language that is compatible with the blockchain network.

In reality, smart contracts are written for a much wider audience. If two parties have the need to perform a trustless exchange of some assets, a smart contract is written which enables the exchange of any assets between any parties - not just for the two specific parties or assets. So smart contracts are typically generic contracts which can be utilized by any parties.

Once the code is deployed on the blockchain, it becomes a permanent record of the agreement, and it can be executed when certain conditions are met. For example, a smart contract that governs the sale of a product might release the funds to the seller once the product has been delivered to the buyer and the buyer has confirmed receipt.

Smart contracts are highly secure because they run on a decentralized network, and they are resistant to fraud or tampering.

## Benefits of smart contracts

The benefits of smart contracts include:

**1. Efficiency:** Smart contracts help with the execution of agreements, reducing the need for intermediaries and manual processes, which saves time and money.

**2. Transparency:** Smart contracts are transparent and immutable, providing a permanent record of the agreement that can be accessed and verified by all parties.

**3. Security:** Smart contracts are highly secure because they run on a decentralized blockchain network, making them resistant to fraud or tampering.

**4. Trust:** Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries and increase trust between parties by ensuring that the terms of the agreement are executed exactly as written.

**5. Cost savings:** Smart contracts reduce the costs associated with intermediaries and manual processes, making them a cost-effective alternative to traditional agreements.

**6. Accessibility:** Smart contracts are accessible to anyone with an internet connection, making them a global solution for conducting business transactions. 

## Applications of smart contracts

There are many use cases and applications of smart contracts across various industries. Here are some of the best examples:

**1. Supply Chain Management:** Smart contracts can help automate and streamline supply chain processes by tracking and verifying the movement of goods, reducing the risk of fraud and errors.

**2. Real Estate:** Smart contracts can be used to automate the process of buying, selling, and renting real estate, reducing the need for intermediaries and increasing efficiency and transparency.

**3. Finance and Banking:** Smart contracts can automate financial transactions such as loans, insurance, and trading, reducing the need for intermediaries and improving efficiency, transparency, and security.

**4. Healthcare:** Smart contracts can help automate and secure medical data sharing, improving patient privacy and data security.

**5. Intellectual Property:** Smart contracts can be used to manage and protect intellectual property, such as patents and copyrights, by automating the licensing and payment process.

**6. Government:** Smart contracts can be used in voting systems, identity verification, and other government processes to increase transparency, security, and efficiency.

**7. Gaming and Sports:** Smart contracts can be used to create transparent and secure gaming and sports betting platforms, reducing the risk of fraud and ensuring fair play.

**8. Digital collectibles:** Smart contracts can form digital ledgers which hold digital collectibles, such as NFTs.
